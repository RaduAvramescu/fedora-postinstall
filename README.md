# Fedora Postinstall Script

This is my personal script which I use immediately after I install Fedora Workstation. It does basic setup, and handles the installation of all the apps I use.

## Usage

Type the following commands in a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/RaduAvramescu/fedora-postinstall.git
cd fedora-postinstall/scripts
chmod u+x ./fedora-postinstall.sh
./fedora-postinstall.sh
```
